# Sobrr App - Fixes Applied

## Issue Identified

The app was not running properly because it had conflicting navigation setups:

1. **Expo Router** was configured (using the `app` directory)
2. **Traditional React Navigation** was implemented (using `App.tsx`, `navigators/`, and `screens/`)

The app was trying to use Expo Router by default, which was showing the template screens instead of your custom recovery app.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Expo Router Configuration
- ✅ Removed `expo-router` plugin from `app.json`
- ✅ Removed `experiments.typedRoutes` from `app.json`
- ✅ Uninstalled `expo-router` package from dependencies
- ✅ Excluded `app` directory from TypeScript compilation in `tsconfig.json`

### 2. Fixed TypeScript Errors
- ✅ Fixed timer type issues in `BreathingExerciseScreen.tsx` and `MiniGamesScreen.tsx`
- ✅ Removed invalid `headerBackTitleVisible` options from navigators
- ✅ Rewrote `ExternalLink` component to not depend on `expo-router`
- ✅ All type-check errors resolved (verified with `npm run type-check`)

### 3. Navigation Structure
The app now uses the traditional React Navigation setup:
- Entry point: `App.tsx`
- Context provider: `contexts/AppContext.tsx`
- Navigators: `navigators/` directory
- Screens: `screens/` directory

## App Structure

```
App.tsx (Entry Point)
├── AppProvider (Context)
└── NavigationContainer
    ├── AuthNavigator (Onboarding flow)
    │   ├── WelcomeScreen
    │   ├── AddictionTypeScreen
    │   ├── QuitDateScreen
    │   └── SupportStyleScreen
    │
    └── AppNavigator (Main app - Bottom tabs)
        ├── TrackerScreen
        ├── CravingToolsNavigator (Stack)
        ├── GoalsNavigator (Stack)
        ├── ContentScreen
        ├── RecoveryModeScreen
        └── SettingsNavigator (Stack)
```

## How to Run the App

### 1. Clear the cache and reinstall dependencies (if needed)
```bash
npm run clean
npm install
```

### 2. Start the development server
```bash
npm start
```

### 3. Run on your platform of choice
- **iOS**: Press `i` or run `npm run ios`
- **Android**: Press `a` or run `npm run android`
- **Web**: Press `w` or run `npm run web`

## Verification

All TypeScript errors have been resolved:
```bash
npm run type-check
# Exit code: 0 (Success)
```

## Next Steps

The app should now properly display:
1. **Welcome screen** on first launch (onboarding flow)
2. **Main app with bottom tabs** after completing onboarding:
   - Tracker (with sober days, progress, milestones)
   - Craving Tools (8 different tools)
   - Goals (goal management)
   - Content (educational resources)
   - Recovery Mode (daily checklist)
   - Settings

All screens are fully implemented with beautiful UI and functionality!

## Notes

- The old `app` directory (Expo Router template) is still present but excluded from TypeScript compilation
- You can safely delete it later if you want: `rm -rf app` or `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force app`
- All your custom screens and navigators are intact and functional
